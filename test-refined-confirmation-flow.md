# Test: Refined Confirmation Flow

## Issue

User wanted to refine the web search flow so that even when a user says "yes please" or similar positive responses, the AI should still show the confirmation form and wait for explicit "confirm" or "cancel" before proceeding.

## Solution Applied

Updated the system prompts in both `generate_chat_response` and `generate_calendar_response` methods to enforce a strict two-step confirmation process.

### Key Changes

**Enhanced Web Search Flow:**

1. **Step 1**: User searches â†’ AI shows results + asks "Would you like to create an event?"
2. **Step 2**: User says "Yes please" â†’ AI shows confirmation form (NOT create event yet)
3. **Step 3**: User types "confirm" â†’ AI creates event

**Updated System Prompt Rules:**

- `3. If the user responds with ANY positive answer (yes, yes please, sure, ok, create it, etc.), ALWAYS show the confirmation form with event details`
- `4. NEVER create an event directly - ALWAYS require explicit confirmation via the confirmation form`
- `5. Wait for user to type 'confirm' or 'cancel' before proceeding`

## Expected Flow

### Scenario 1: Manchester United vs Arsenal Match

**User Action**: Click Search button with "Manchester United vs Arsenal match tomorrow"

**AI Response 1**:

```
I found information about the Manchester United vs Arsenal match. Here are the details:

[Search results with match details...]

Would you like me to create a calendar event for this match?
```

**User Action**: Type "Yes please" and click Send

**AI Response 2**:

```
Based on the search results, I can create an event with these details:

---
ðŸ“… **Event Details:**
**Title:** Manchester United vs Arsenal
**Date & Time:** [Match date and time]
**Location:** [Stadium if available]
**Description:** Premier League match between Manchester United and Arsenal
---
Please confirm: Type 'confirm' to create, 'cancel' to abort, or 'modify [details]' to change something.
```

**User Action**: Type "confirm" and click Send

**AI Response 3**:

```
âœ… Event created successfully! The Manchester United vs Arsenal match has been added to your calendar.
```

### Scenario 2: User Declines

**User Action**: Click Search button with "Taylor Swift concert Sydney"

**AI Response 1**:

```
I found information about Taylor Swift concerts in Sydney. Here are the details:

[Search results...]

Would you like me to add this concert to your calendar?
```

**User Action**: Type "No thanks" and click Send

**AI Response 2**:

```
No problem! The search results are there if you change your mind later. Is there anything else I can help you with?
```

## Test Cases

### Positive Responses That Should Show Confirmation Form

- "Yes"
- "Yes please"
- "Sure"
- "Ok"
- "Create it"
- "Add it"
- "Go ahead"
- "That sounds good"

### Confirmation Responses

- "confirm" â†’ Create event
- "cancel" â†’ Don't create event
- "modify [details]" â†’ Update and show new confirmation

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Search button triggers web search
- [ ] AI shows search results
- [ ] AI asks about event creation
- [ ] User says "Yes please" â†’ AI shows confirmation form (NOT create event)
- [ ] User types "confirm" â†’ Event is created
- [ ] User types "cancel" â†’ No event created
- [ ] User types "modify" â†’ Shows updated confirmation form
- [ ] All positive responses trigger confirmation form
- [ ] No direct event creation without explicit "confirm"

## Key Benefits

1. **Double Confirmation**: Prevents accidental event creation
2. **Clear Intent**: User must explicitly type "confirm" to proceed
3. **Consistent Flow**: Same process for all positive responses
4. **User Control**: Easy to cancel or modify before final creation
5. **Safety**: No surprises - user always knows what will be created
