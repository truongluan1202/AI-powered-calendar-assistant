# Test: Fixed Confirm Event Issue

## Issue Fixed

When clicking "confirm" after a web search, the backend was responding with:
"I'm sorry, I wasn't able to create the event. It seems there was an issue with the event creation tool."

## Root Cause

The backend was trying to handle `handleEventConfirmation` tool calls and returning a message saying "Tool should be handled by frontend". The LLM was interpreting this as an error, even though `success: True` was set.

## Solution Applied

### Backend Changes

**`apps/backend/app/services/llm.py`**:

- Updated `execute_tool_call()` to raise `NotImplementedError` for non-webSearch tools
- This prevents the backend from returning confusing messages

**`apps/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/chat.py`**:

- Added try-catch around `execute_tool_call()` to handle `NotImplementedError`
- Backend now only processes `webSearch` tool calls internally
- Other tool calls (`getEvents`, `handleEventConfirmation`) are returned to frontend

### Frontend Changes

**`apps/frontend/src/lib/tools.ts`**:

- Already correctly handles `handleEventConfirmation` tool calls
- No changes needed

## New Flow

### ✅ Web Search Only

```
User searches → LLM calls webSearch → Backend handles internally → Returns search results
```

### ✅ Web Search + Event Confirmation

```
User searches → LLM calls webSearch → Backend handles webSearch → Returns search results
User says "Yes please" → LLM shows confirmation format
User types "confirm" → LLM calls handleEventConfirmation → Backend returns to frontend → Frontend executes → Event created
```

### ✅ Direct Event Creation

```
User requests event → LLM shows confirmation format
User types "confirm" → LLM calls handleEventConfirmation → Backend returns to frontend → Frontend executes → Event created
```

## Key Changes

### Backend Tool Execution

```python
# Before (causing error)
else:
    return {
        "tool_call_id": tool_call["id"],
        "content": f"Tool '{tool_name}' should be handled by frontend",
        "success": True,
    }

# After (fixed)
else:
    raise NotImplementedError(f"Tool '{tool_name}' not implemented in backend")
```

### Backend Chat Endpoint

```python
# Added try-catch to handle NotImplementedError
for tool_call in web_search_calls:
    try:
        result = await llm_service.execute_tool_call(tool_call)
        tool_results.append(result)
    except NotImplementedError:
        # Tool not implemented in backend, skip it
        pass
```

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Web Search Button

**Input**: Click Search button with "Manchester United vs Arsenal match tomorrow"
**Expected**:

- Backend handles webSearch internally
- Returns search results
- No error messages

### Test 2: Web Search + Event Creation

**Input**: Search → User says "Yes please" → User types "confirm"
**Expected**:

- Web search handled by backend
- Confirmation format shown
- User confirms
- Event created successfully
- No error messages

### Test 3: Direct Event Creation

**Input**: "Add meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm" → User types "confirm"
**Expected**:

- Confirmation format shown
- User confirms
- Event created successfully
- No error messages

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Web search button works without errors
- [ ] Search results displayed correctly
- [ ] Event confirmation works after web search
- [ ] Direct event creation works
- [ ] No "event creation tool" error messages
- [ ] Backend only handles webSearch internally
- [ ] Frontend handles handleEventConfirmation correctly
- [ ] Mixed tool calls work properly

## Expected Behavior Now

**When you search and confirm an event:**

1. **Search**: Backend handles webSearch internally
2. **Confirmation**: Frontend handles handleEventConfirmation
3. **Result**: Event created successfully with proper confirmation message

**No more error messages about "event creation tool" issues!**
