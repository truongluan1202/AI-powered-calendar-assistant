# Test: Confirmation Format Without createEvent Tool

## Issue

Need to ensure that the AI shows the confirmation format (structured event details) without calling the `createEvent` tool, even when all information is confirmed from web search or user input. The AI should only call `createEvent` after the user explicitly types "confirm".

## Solution Applied

Updated the system prompts to make it crystal clear that:

1. **Show confirmation format** = Display structured event details (NOT call createEvent)
2. **Wait for "confirm"** = Only then use handleEventConfirmation tool
3. **Never call createEvent directly** = Always use handleEventConfirmation tool

### Key Changes Made

**Updated EVENT CREATION CONFIRMATION PROCESS:**

- `1. First, present the event details clearly in a confirmation format (DO NOT call createEvent tool yet)`
- `3. ONLY when user responds with 'confirm', use handleEventConfirmation tool`
- `5. NEVER call createEvent tool directly - always use handleEventConfirmation tool`

**Updated createEvent Tool Description:**

- `"description": "Create a new event in Google Calendar. DO NOT use this tool directly - always use handleEventConfirmation tool instead"`

## Expected Flow

### Scenario 1: Web Search â†’ Confirmation Format

**User Action**: Search "Manchester United vs Arsenal match tomorrow"

**AI Response 1**:

```
I found information about the Manchester United vs Arsenal match. Here are the details:

[Search results...]

Would you like me to create a calendar event for this match?
```

**User Action**: Type "Yes please"

**AI Response 2** (Confirmation Format - NO createEvent tool called):

```
Based on the search results, I can create an event with these details:

---
ðŸ“… **Event Details:**
**Title:** Manchester United vs Arsenal
**Date & Time:** [Match date and time]
**Location:** [Stadium if available]
**Description:** Premier League match between Manchester United and Arsenal
---
Please confirm: Type 'confirm' to create, 'cancel' to abort, or 'modify [details]' to change something.
```

**User Action**: Type "confirm"

**AI Response 3** (NOW calls handleEventConfirmation tool):

```
âœ… Event created successfully! The Manchester United vs Arsenal match has been added to your calendar.
```

### Scenario 2: Direct Event Request â†’ Confirmation Format

**User Action**: Type "Add meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm"

**AI Response 1** (Confirmation Format - NO createEvent tool called):

```
I can create an event with these details:

---
ðŸ“… **Event Details:**
**Title:** Meeting with John
**Date & Time:** Tomorrow 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM
**Location:** [Not specified]
**Description:** [Not specified]
---
Please confirm: Type 'confirm' to create, 'cancel' to abort, or 'modify [details]' to change something.
```

**User Action**: Type "confirm"

**AI Response 2** (NOW calls handleEventConfirmation tool):

```
âœ… Event created successfully! Your meeting with John has been added to your calendar.
```

## Key Rules Enforced

1. **Confirmation Format = Display Only**: Shows structured event details without calling any tools
2. **No Direct createEvent**: Never call createEvent tool directly
3. **handleEventConfirmation Only**: Only use handleEventConfirmation tool after "confirm"
4. **Two-Step Process**: Always show confirmation format first, then wait for "confirm"

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Web search shows confirmation format (no createEvent called)
- [ ] Direct event request shows confirmation format (no createEvent called)
- [ ] User types "confirm" â†’ handleEventConfirmation tool called
- [ ] User types "cancel" â†’ handleEventConfirmation tool called with cancel
- [ ] User types "modify" â†’ handleEventConfirmation tool called with modify
- [ ] createEvent tool never called directly
- [ ] All positive responses trigger confirmation format display
- [ ] Confirmation format is properly structured with event details

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Confirmation format is just display, not action
2. **User Control**: User must explicitly confirm before any tool calls
3. **Consistent Flow**: Same process for all event creation scenarios
4. **Safety**: No accidental event creation
5. **Transparency**: User always sees exactly what will be created
